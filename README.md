# Target

A game of target practice.

The goal of the game is to push the "fire" button when the middle LED (PIN 7) is lit up.
when you hit, you go to the next level.
when you miss, you loose and the game have to restart.

- LEDs should be connected to PINs 4 - 11
- A "fire" button should be connected to PIN 2
- A "reset" button can optionally be connected to PIN 3, functionality is not great though.
